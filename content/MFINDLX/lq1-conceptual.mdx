## Pneumatics
* From Greek "*pneuma*" meaning "breath"
* Application of air-powered actuators and their control devices
* Study of gasses, its properties, and applications at higher & lower than atmospheric pressures 

## Units used
* 1 bar = 100 kPa
* 1 psi = 6894.75 Pa
* 1 atm = 101325 Pa

## Boyle's & Charles's law
<BlockMath math="\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}" />
wherein $P$ is in pascals, $V$ in cubic meters, and $T$ in kelvin.

## Humidity
| Term | Definition
| --- | ---
| Humidity | Presence of water vapor in the air
| Absolute humidity | actual quantity of water in 1 m³ of air
| Saturation quantity | quantity of water which 1 m³ of air can hold at a certain temperature
| Relative humidity | $ \frac{\text{absolute humidity}}{\text{saturation quantity}} \times 100% $

### Dew point
Water content is on the Y-axis, and the temperature is on the X-axis. The 100% curve is the saturation quantity.
