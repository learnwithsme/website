You have three hand taps of different sizes. 

* Use the one with the least thread first.
* After, use the one with more thread.
* Last, use the one with the most thread.

Identifying which is which can be difficult. Look at the tip to see their differences.

## Motion

Remember these steps when you're already tapping:
* 180˚ clockwise
* 90˚ counterclockwise

This is to ensure that the hand tap will be effective. It also reduces the chance for it to snap and break.

Don't forget to lubricate with oil as you twist.
