## Handheld drill

* Keep your arm steady. Not doing so will cause the drill to move on its own in unwanted ways.
* Make sure it is set to the correct mode â€“ whether drilling or screwing.
* Press the button lightly to start drilling. 

## Drill press

* Punch the workpiece first with a center punch beforehand.
* Make sure that the workpiece is tight and secured.
* Make sure you are wearing safety glasses.
* After mounting the drill bit, make sure it is aligned to the center punched hole.
* Turn on the press and slightly pull it down.
* Press it down a bit to cut a small hole, then lift it to remove the chips inside.
* Use a brush to remove the chips.
* Repeat the process until the desired hole is achieved.
