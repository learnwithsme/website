## Safety
* Wearing gloves (the one with a rubberized palm) is highly recommended to protect from metal dust.
* If filing with bare hands, do not touch other body parts (especially the eyes).
* If you're injured while filing, immediately tell to your professor in order for you to recieve a tetanus shot.

## Method
* Clamp the workpiece and file by moving the file forward against the workpiece.
* DO NOT clamp the file and move the workpiece yourself.
* Apply pressure to the file using your other hand to make the filing even and straight.
* Use the coarse file first, then use the fine file for final touch-ups.
* It is a good idea to file a little bit, then measure if it's ok already, then repeat.
