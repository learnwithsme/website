A little oneâ€™s guide to materials. This video gives us an idea about why certain materials are being used in products and how the improvement of existing materials (or the creation of new ones) contributes to the development of the things we use every day.

In this video, a detailed introduction to what we need to know about materials engineering is given. The instructor helps us understand why we need to study materials and how they can help us select/improve/create the best one to fit our needs. Also, we learn about the relationship among processing, structure, and properties of a material, as well as the different material properties a material can have that we would look into when selecting or creating a material.
