## Dimensional Measurements

Dimensional measurement is an important part of metrology. Among the topics under this topic involves the differentiation of accuracy and precision. Measurement reading may be accurate but not precise while other measurements may be precise but not accurate. This video may help us understand the difference between accuracy and precision and understand their relevance in the field of metrology.

Measurement devices are also constrained by resolution and sensitivity. These two are often interconnected but in reality, they are entirely different. Click on this video link to learn more about resolution and sensitivity.

To attain accurate and precise measurement reading you need to have a reliable and stable measuring instrument. [This article](https://qualitytrainingportal.com/resources/measurement-system-analysis/measurement-system-stability/) will explain more about reliability and stability. 

Aside from the topics mentioned above, it is also important to have an understanding of how different measurement devices work.

The steel rule is one of the measurement devices used in metrology. This video will present an overview of the steel rule.

Caliper gauges also help attain measurement readings. To learn more about caliper gauges, you may refer to [this article](https://www.higherprecision.com/blog/what-is-a-caliper-gage). 

Micrometers also help us in dimensional measurement. [This article](https://www.britannica.com/technology/micrometer) will briefly explain all about micrometers. 

[This article](https://uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/media/lectures/5/5_2018_12_25!06_05_55_PM.pdf) provides a brief overview of what you would expect in this course. 

## Measurement using a steel rule

You can measure accurately using a steel rule. This video demonstrates how to use the ruler accurately.

[This document](https://littlemachineshop.com/images/gallery/instructions/steelrules.pdf) gives you an overview all about steel rulers. 


## Measurement using inside and outside caliper 


Aside from using rulers, manufacturing engineers can also use calipers for measurement dimensions. [This article](https://www.britannica.com/technology/caliper-measurement-instrument#ref177973) will help you understand what are calipers. 

There are also different types of calipers available in the market. [This article](https://rxmechanic.com/types-of-calipers/) explains some of their differences and provides pictures for reference. 

## Measurement using vernier caliper 

The vernier caliper is a more precise type of caliper used for dimensional measurements. To learn more about the vernier caliper, refer to [this article](https://www.britannica.com/technology/vernier-caliper).

A vernier caliper can be used for inside and outside diameter measurements. To discover more about how to use this type of measurement device you may watch this video.

## Measurement of a plain ring gauge 

A plain ring gauge is a standardized measurement tool used to assess whether a hole has a specific diameter. [This article](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/instruments-controls/all-about-ring-gauges/) will further explain more about these ring gauges. 

It is also essential to understand the use of slip gauges. This video will demonstrate what slip gauges are and how to use them.
