This video includes a brief introduction to reaction rates and includes examples of calculating average reaction rates and reaction rates of reactants or products relative to other reactants or products using stoichiometry. Do note that these examples will make use only of a single chemical reaction, occurring under closed conditions, constant volume, and without build up of reaction intermediates.

This video includes a discussion on five factors that affect reaction rates. These include nature of reactants, concentration, surface area, catalysts (and activation energy), and temperature.

| Chemical kinetics.  | This article includes a discussion on general chemical kinetics and its theory and practice. It also discusses the definitions of reaction rate, rate law, rate constant, and integrated rate law, with several examples that establish the relationship of time and chemical reactions. The article is generally comprehensive and discusses other sub-topics in-depth under chemical kinetics such as Direct-Computation Fixed-Time Integral Methods, Curve-Fitting Methods, etc. Such may not be included/required in the BASCHEM syllabus, but may still be useful for future reference or research. | [Read here](https://chem.libretexts.org/Under_Construction/Purgatory/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.0_(Harvey)/13_Kinetic_Methods/13.2%3A_Chemical_Kinetics)
| Rate Laws. | This article includes a discussion on rate laws. It first explains the form and function of a rate law, teaches how to use rate laws to calculate reaction rates, and how to use rate and concentration data to identify reaction orders and derive rate laws. The specific examples given are focused on writing rate laws from reaction orders, determining a rate law from initial rates, and determining rate laws from initial rates. The latter part of the article also emphasizes on some remarks about reaction order and rate constant units.  | [Read here](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Chemistry_1e_(OpenSTAX)/12%3A_Kinetics/12.3%3A_Rate_Laws)
