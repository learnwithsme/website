This 8-minute video includes a discussion on Entropy, the three Thermodynamics’ Laws, spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes, and Gibbs Free Energy (G). The video is visually appealing and easy-to-understand.

This video discusses the relationship between free energy and equilibrium and how reactants or products are favored. Conditions and characteristics are also discussed with regards to Standard Free Energy difference (ΔG°) when it is greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to 0 in terms of spontaneity and K. To further summarize the relationships among the different quantities in free energy and equilibrium constant analysis.

| The laws of thermodynamics.  | This article extensively delves into the three laws of thermodynamics for further reading. | [Read here](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Thermodynamics_and_Chemical_Equilibrium_(Ellgen)/06%3A_Equilibrium_States_and_Reversible_Processes/6.13%3A_The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics)
| Gibbs Free energy. | This article includes a summarized discussion on Gibbs Free Energy as a quantity calculated using the free energy of formation of each component of a reaction at standard pressure. Furthermore, the article also discusses free energy changes in chemical reactions, free energy changes for nonstandard states, pressure and free energy, as well as free energy and work. The latter topics may not be required under the syllabus,  but they are still relevant information regarding the main topic. | [Read here](https://www.collegesidekick.com/study-guides/boundless-chemistry/gibbs-free-energy)
| Free energy and equilibrium. | This article discusses Free Energy and Equilibrium, specifically on the relationship of free energy and the equilibrium constant. It involves yet again a review on spontaneity but with regards to Gibbs free energy and Entropy, then the main relationship of free energy and the equilibrium constant in concept and in equations. The link also contains several example problems with solutions that are helpful in understanding the topic. | [Read here](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Bellarmine_University/BU%3A_Chem_104_(Christianson)/Phase_3%3A_Harnessing_Chemical_Power/9%3A_Thermodynamics/9.5%3A_Free_Energy_and_Equilibrium)
