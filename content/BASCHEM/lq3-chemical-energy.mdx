This video includes a comprehensive discussion on energy changes in concept and in graphical representation of energy in chemical reactions, as well as exothermic (e.g. explosion/combustion) and endothermic reactions (e.g. photosynthesis). The discussion also delves into chemical reaction concepts such as activation energy, energy change, enthalpy, and catalysts (reduces activation energy). The video also has sample problem solving examples for bond energy calculations.

This video includes an introductory discussion of thermodynamics, specifically on the thermochemistry of heat, enthalpy, and change in enthalpy (ΔH). It also reviews endothermic and exothermic reactions with respect to energy changes and proceeds to a comprehensive discussion on heat (q) that flows from an area of high temperature to an area of low temperature. The video ends with a comprehension-check through  a simple problem solving example.

This video includes a discussion that directly continues the discussion in the previous video entitled Thermochemistry: Heat and Enthalpy. This video starts with a conceptual introduction about heat capacity (C), specific heat (s), and calorimetry equations such as q = CΔT. The video also includes a few simple example problems that make use of the said calorimetry equation.

## Additional article: Energy and chemical change. 

This article comprehensively discussed energy and chemical change. It talks about energy transfers and chemical reactions as well as energy and reaction stoichiometry sample problem scenarios. This link would also contain hyperlinks (below the article) to other important subtopics regarding chemical energy such as 6.1: Energy, Heat and Work, 6.2: Calorimetry, 6.5: Enthalpy, and 6.6: Putting it All Together (a summary page). It is also advisable to look into 6.3: The First Law of Thermodynamics, as a review for the next and last set of lessons for BASCHEM.
