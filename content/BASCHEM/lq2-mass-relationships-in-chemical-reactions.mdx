This video includes an in depth discussion on amounts of reactants and products, limiting reagents, percent yield, and theoretical yield, by solving an example problem through stoichiometry. It also includes a short review on writing balanced equations. This video discussion is also a simulation of an easy-to-follow synchronous class for only 35 minutes.
