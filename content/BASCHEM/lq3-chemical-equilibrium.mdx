This video gives an introduction on chemical equilibrium/equilibria and reaction quotients. It discusses how chemical reactions are reversible in equilibrium, equilibrium expressions, equilibrium constants, and equilibrium constant expression, and direction of the reaction. The ICE method for solving chemical equilibrium problems is also discussed in the video.

## Additional article

The article includes a discussion on general chemical equilibrium, equilibrium constant (expressed as K), Q and K values, and predicting relative amounts of reactants and products based on the equilibrium constant. It also includes a discussion on conditions and types of equilibrium and reaction quotient (Q).
