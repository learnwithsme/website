## I. Some Important notes:

* Energy is neither created nor destroyed. It only changes forms. (1ˢᵗ Law of Thermodynamics)
* Heat (q) flows from an area of high temperature to an area of low temperature. In a classical convention, Q is positive if heat is being absorbed by a system, and negative if heat is being released by the system. Otherwise, the opposite is called an alternative convention.
* When temperature (T) and pressure (P) are constant, q = AH
* In thermochemistry, the common units to express energy are in terms of joules (J),* kilojoules (kJ), and calorie (1 calorie = 4.184 J, where the term calorie is different from food Calorie expressed with an uppercase "C").
