This video evinces how to graph a polynomial function by using the end behavior, zeroes, and multiplicities of the said function. It is a simple method of sketching the graph of a polynomial function. Note: It is just a rough sketch meant to show what the graph looks like.

This video is pertinent to the first video. However, it shows how the roots of the function are determined by using the Rational Zero Theorem, Descartes Rule of Signs, and Synthetic Division. These methods are used in lieu of factoring (i.e., equations that cannot be done by factoring).
Note: Try to factor it out. If not plausible, then proceed to the said methods.

This video further explains how Descartes' Rule of Signs works. It helps to narrow down the number of options to be used in the synthetic division. It will improve the efficiency of the trial-and-error method.

This video clearly shows the step-by-step procedure of graphing a rational function. It also illustrates how to graph the three different cases of the said function by using the sign analysis that will be further explained in the video.

The indicated video presents more examples of sketching rational functions in a step-by-step way. Practice makes perfect!

Theis illustrates how to graph and write conic sections (Circles, Ellipses, Parabolas, Hyperbola). This will help you understand the fundamental knowledge that will be needed when you go to advanced Calculus classes.
