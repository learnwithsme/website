This video introduces the basic idea about the definition of limits. It is the first of a 4-part video series. As such, please watch the proceeding parts to further grasp the idea.

This is the part 2 of the prior video. It envices the idea behind the formal definition (i.e., the epsilon-delta) of limits. Likewise, please watch the subsequent two videos.

This video illustrates how the building idea supports the formation of the mathematical definition of limits. The epsilon-delta definition pertains to the formal definition of the aforementioned topic. Watch the next video to further understand them via an example.

This video evinces the proving of limits using the epsilon-delta definition. With the use of example, it clearly depicts how the mathematical formula proved the limits.

This video explains what continuity is. It also illustrates the different types of discontinuity: Point, Infinite, & Jump Discontinuity. Furthermore, the video classifies them as either  removable or nonremovable discontinuities.

This video shows how to determine the points of discontinuity and to prove whether a function is continuous or discontinuous at a certain point. The video used the 3 step continuity test that will be further explained as you watch it.
