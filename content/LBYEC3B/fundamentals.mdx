This video is a tutorial on the basics of MATLAB. Starting from the timestamp 4:00, the instructor Mr. Azam introduces the MATLAB environment. The different parts of the MATLAB Graphical User Interface are explored and their functions are demonstrated in the video with the use of basic MATLAB commands. In the video, the idea of MATLAB being a “Matrix Laboratory” was also shown through the explanation of how variables are stored and operate in MATLAB (see timestamp 15:45).

For LBYEC3B Laboratory Exercise #1, students were asked to encode various matrices in MATLAB. These matrices can be encoded by listing the elements of the matrices one by one. Alternatively, some of the matrices can be encoded using combinations of the zeros() and eye() commands explained in this video.
