## Introduction
Kinematics is the branch of dynamics which describes the motion of bodies without reference to the forces which either cause the motion or are generated as a result of the motion. Kinematics is often described as the “geometry of motion.”

## General Rectilinear Motion
#### Displacement (s) 
* The change in the position coordinate during a time interval 
* How far is the distance between the initial and final positions?

$$ s = x - x_{0} $$

#### Velocity (v)
* The time rate of change of the displacement (s) 
* How fast did the displacement change?
* The first derivative of s

$$ v = \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{displacement}{time} $$

#### Acceleration (a) 
* The time rate of change of the velocity (v)
* How fast did the velocity change?
* The second derivative of s

$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\frac{change \space in \space velocity}{time} $$

#### Relationship between s, v, and a
$$ v \space dv=a \space ds $$

#### Speed vs Velocity
* Speed uses the distance traveled by the particle
* Velocity uses the displacement of the particle

$$ speed = \frac{distance}{time} $$

$$ velocity = \frac{displacement}{time} $$

## General Rectilinear Motion with Uniform/Constant Acceleration
These equations cannot be used for variable acceleration.

$$ s = s_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2 $$

$$ v=v_0+at $$

$$ v^2=v^2_0+2a(s-s_0) $$

## Free Falling Bodies
General rectilinear motion in the y-axis. Acceleration is constant (g = 9.81 m/s2)

$$ h = h_0+v_0t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$

$$ v=v_0-gt $$

$$ v^2=v^2_0-2g(h-h_0) $$
