## Introduction to Curvilinear Motion
The motion of a particle is now along a curved path that lies in a single plane. It can be defined using rectangular (x and y) or normal and tangential (n and t) components.

## Rectangular Components
Useful for describing motions where the x and y components are independent. The resulting curvilinear motion is a vector combination of the x and y components. Formulas for s, v, and a from Module 1 are still used here.

$$ v^2=v^2_x+v^2_y $$

$$ a^2=a^2_x+a^2_y $$

$$ tan(\theta)=\frac{v_y}{v_x} $$

## Projectile Motion
Uses rectangular components for trajectory analysis of a projectile. Constant acceleration is present in both x and y directions, a_x = 0 m/s^2, ay = -g = 9.81 m/s^2. The following equations are derived from Module 1 utilizing the given constraints.

$$ v_y=v_{y0}-gt $$

$$ y=y_0+v_{y0}-\frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$

$$ v^2_y=v^2_{y0}-2g(y-y_0) $$
