## Design me a Hydraulic Jack

As an introduction to the course, students were tasked to identify the design considerations and factors when it comes to making a hand pump hydraulic jack. These include the the hydraulic jack specifications, manufacturing processes/materials, and stresses involved.  One of the advisers in this class said,  a designer should always keep in mind that the design of one part of the machine will have an affect to another part(s). This is especially true given that the stresses involved in the ram piston of the jack (which is directly involved in lifting the weight) will translate to the stresses experienced by the pump handle, ram cylinder, and other connected components.

Here, one of the groups shared their output to this activity.
